## Blood Volunteer Application

### Nowadays, the voluntary blood donation movement in Vietnam has been accessible to majority of young people. However, the amount of blood received has not met the required amount of blood. Volunteers who want to donate blood should ensure their health requirements. The minimum time between two blood donations must be at least three months. Based on these practical requirements, the thesis proposes a tool to support the management of blood donation. This app supports the management of blood donation history, finding people who are abled to donate blood within the nearest possible range. This tool is built on a three-layer model, using Entity Framework to interact with the database. The application was experimented on a website with data of blood donation from volunteers living in Binh Thanh District, Go Vap District bEntity Framework ore putting it into practical use.
